# Tower of Hanoi game

A visual puzzle whereby you have to move all the disks from the pole at one end to the pole at the other, moving one disk at a time without a larger disk ever being above a smaller one. This project forces you to conform to these rules, tracks your move count and lets you know of the optimum move count so you can try and improve your performance, whilst trying to complete the main challenge.
